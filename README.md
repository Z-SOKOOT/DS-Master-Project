the business case is all about as follows:

Finding the best opportunity for selling more house to people. 
To do so, We need to find the factors that affect the price and find the people's interest of houses.
So, the benefits of this action is to building new house based on these factors and sell more the houses that already built. 
To show which factors are more important for buyers and in which time they are willing to buy a house more. 
In this case, we can focuse to sell more in these factors.
( for example increase the store manager in some special time of the year and in specific suburb that are more interested by people.) 
As a future work, Find the best agents and research more about their method of sell and add relevant data to this part.
